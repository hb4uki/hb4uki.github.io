              "I found it really poetic how the program and our learning played out on Antarctica’s landscape, the mental journey mirroring the physical one. Never still, always changing. This really helped me to see the importance of being present. We are all so distracted nowadays! It is preventing us from giving and receiving 100&#37;. <br><br>

One of the most significant takeaways for me has been the power of rewriting internal narratives. Before Homeward Bound I had been reflecting on how much of maturing is actually undoing a lot of what you have learned, and reverting to a child-like state uncoloured by your pain. Homeward Bound solidified this and opened my eyes to the – horrifying – amount of societal conditioning we have endured especially as women and especially in academia. How being a polite and quiet "good girl" is rewarded, and speaking up is squashed or even reprimanded. We have to re-question everything we took as assumed knowledge, and figure out if we should keep that belief as real learning, or throw it out as having stemmed from false assumptions after bad experiences or flawed and biased systemic pressures. We have to continually look back to our value systems to navigate this landscape. For me that is natural, my difficult personal life meant I discarded the beliefs that others put on me long ago and set to figuring things out myself. I know myself and my value system very well, it gives me strength. What shocked me was how unsafe I have still felt, and how much I have been exhausting myself because of this. Imagine if all that time and energy we put into over-analysing and questioning ourselves were poured into the things we cared about – if we are achieving this much now, what could we achieve then? We need to optimise our thinking patterns for both success and happiness, and the quality of our relationships. Be kind and generous with your own stories, and with everyone else’s! If you can believe everyone is doing their best, it will change the way you perceive their actions and how you interact with them. <br><br>

So, I am learning to talk to myself differently, and courageously embrace my vulnerability. Vulnerability is not a weakness, it is honest and human, and it is a strength. I’m speaking up more and more about the little things as much as the big. We have to take responsibility for the communities and cultures we are a part of. Our behaviours shape them as much as the next person’s, and if we want something different, we have to step up to that. If not you then who? If not now, then when? &#35;strongertogether &#35;takeyourplace"
